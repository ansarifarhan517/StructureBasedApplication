# StructureBasedApplication
This is the Structure Based application where the UI is Loaded from structureand contains both front end and backend

Currently In the backend we have Three Collection that is label ,structure, and countries but the idea is to move the countries in SQL Server  and for that we have Created the Scripts for SQL Server in the Database/SQL folder
